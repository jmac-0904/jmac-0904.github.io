# Start Here

This channel is a "Quick Start" guide for newcomers to the server.

- World setting and server info: [About Us](welcome.md)
- If you need help or have questions about getting started on the server, please reach out to `#beginner-help`! 
- If you have any other questions, please reach out to `#server-questions`!

## New to D&D?
Head over to [New to D&D](new-to-dnd.md), which has a step-by-step guide for making your first D&D character!

## Server Rules for Character Creation
Character creation rules can be found in [Character Creation Rules](cc-rules.md).

## Stats/Gold/HP
It is entirely optional to roll for stats/gold/hp. However, once you have made the rolls, you must use the rolled results. 
- All rolls must be made in `⁠#official-character-rolls` for it to be valid.

### Stats
> You may use Standard Array / Point Buy / Rolling for the character stats.  
> - For rolling, use `!rollstats` in `#official-character-rolls`.
> 
> You are only permitted one roll per character, and the command will give you stats that are to our server's minimum standard.
> 
> :icon-alert: Do not roll stats on DnD Beyond!
> You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling.
> You can switch to rolling from Standard Array/Point Buy if you are still in the character creation stage.

### Gold
To roll for gold, follow the instructions pinned in `#official-character-rolls`. Please note that if you roll for gold, you cannot take equipment or gold from your class or background.

> You may take starting equipment or roll for gold. 
> - If you choose to take starting equipment, the item must be available in the regular market. The market document can be found here: [DW Snowhaven Market](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU/)
>
> Once you have rolled the gold and imported your sheet in `#character-sheets`, you may then purchase the equipment in the `#transaction-log`. The market document is linked in `#advanced-play-rules`.

### HP
> We recommend that you choose **fixed value HP** as described in PHB. You may choose to roll HP following the instructions pinned in `#⁠official-character-rolls`.

## Character Sheet Options
To play on the server, your character sheet needs to be compatible with Avrae Bot. 
- The three options are: GSheet, DiceCloud or D&D Beyond (DDB).

**(Optional) How to get content sharing links on D&D Beyond**
> Thanks to the support of our patrons as well as a club account from D&D Beyond, we are able to provide you with all paid material via content sharing links if you are using D&D Beyond for your character sheet. To benefit from this, follow the instructions pinned in `#ddb-link-request` and submit the request.

## Character Options
For information on allowed/banned material as well as allowed UA and homebrew options, please have a look at [Character Creation Rules](cc-rules.md).

- Your characters start at **Level 1**. 
- You are **not** allowed to possess any magic items starting out.

When given options, choose following:
> - Optional Class Features and Custom Origin are allowed (note: approved materials only).
> - Select **Milestone**, not XP. This is because we use a slightly different XP progression, which is managed within the server through Avrae.
> - Carrying capacity: Use Encumbrance
> - Ignore coin weight: Off

## Change Your Server Nickname
Change your Server Nickname to **Name of Character (Race Class).**

Examples:
> Myrdin (Halfling Ranger) 
> 
> Panadol (Drow Warlock)

## Upload Your Character Sheet
In `#character-sheets`, replace the `<link>` with the link of your character sheet.

```
!import <link>
```

If you have used standard array or point buy, declare so after you upload your sheet. 

You DO NOT need to wait for your sheet to be approved.
Once you've uploaded your sheet to `#character-sheets`, you will be automatically granted **Newbie** and **Level 1** roles, and the rest of the server should now be visible. If for some reason the bot fails, you can get the roles manually in `#roles`.

## Set Up the Character for the Server
Follow the steps in **HOW_TO_START_PLAYING** to set up your character for the server.
